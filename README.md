PHP Form Processing and Database Access
In this assignment, you will create a User Loan Search Directory that allows the user to retrieve data from an Access database using PHP and SQL.
Part I – order_search.php
Create a “order_search.php” page that contains a text box for the user to input a Last Name. When the “Search” button is clicked, the Last Name is posted to search_results.php.
Part II – search_results.php
The search_results.php page uses the Last Name input by the user to search (SELECT FROM) the orders table. If a match is found, the following information is displayed for the user:
First Name
Last Name
Product
Unit Price
Discount Rate
Order Total
Payment Type
Card Number (12 (*) + last four digits)

If no match is found, display the message “Sorry, no matches found”
Use the include() or require() function to include your header.php, footer.php, and connection.php files.
